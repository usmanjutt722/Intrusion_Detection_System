### Enhanced AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System

# Project Overview:

This project focuses on building a robust, AI-powered intrusion detection system (IDS) using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Models were trained and evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, covering both traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and a deep learning model (Feedforward Neural Network, FNN).

# Dataset Summary:
Dataset: UNSW-NB15
Description: The dataset contains a comprehensive set of normal and malicious network flows captured in a realistic environment.
Key Features:
1. 49 features (after preprocessing 42 numeric features were used)

Binary classification: Normal vs. Attack

Realistic modern attack types including DoS, Analysis, Exploits, etc.
