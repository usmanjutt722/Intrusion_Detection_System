## Enhanced AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a robust, AI-powered intrusion detection system (IDS) using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Models were trained and evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, covering both traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and a deep learning model (Feedforward Neural Network, FNN).
